## Short description

### The problem

World is so much populated. 2 out of 10 people are not receiving good medical assistance. 1 out of 10 people are dying because of improper treatment in emergency situations. The only solution to all these problems is **Amigo**.

### The Technology

The Health Bot technology is a cloud platform that empowers developers in Healthcare organizations to build and deploy their compliant, AI-powered virtual health assistants. Azure platform is auto scalable,flexible and reliable. These combination give rise to new health era.

### The idea

Our idea is to provide 24/7 health assistance services to any number of people at any time. Azure platform and Health bot services make this possible.

## The architecture

![Video transcription/translation app](https://developer.ibm.com/developer/tutorials/cfc-starter-kit-speech-to-text-app-example/images/cfc-covid19-remote-education-diagram-2.png)

1. The user navigates to the site and uploads a video file.
2. Watson Speech to Text processes the audio and extracts the text.
3. Watson Translation (optionally) can translate the text to the desired language.
4. The app stores the translated text as a document within Object Storage.

## Long description
